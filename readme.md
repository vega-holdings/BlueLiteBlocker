### About

Modded to allow you to hide tweets from accounts based on follower counts, does not affect oomfies or mutuals or give a shit about blue check status.

Would be cool to color code basted on ratio (thanks tafphorisms) as well, might fuck with it more later.

Thanks ChatGPT for helping get this done.

Thanks BlueLiteBlocker for extension.
